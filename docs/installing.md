This will open the browser and ask you to sign into your Khulnasoft account. If you do not have a Khulnasoft account yet, you will be redirected to create an account.

*Why do we require an account? In order to remove abuse of the product and make sure that we know you are an early user, we ask to authorize Khulnasoft extensions with an account before use. We do not use, share, or sell any identifying information for any purpose.*

## All Done!
